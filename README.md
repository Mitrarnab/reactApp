# TextFormatting

I created a React app named **TextFormatting** on GitHub. This application allows users to easily manipulate their text in various ways. With TextFormatting, you can:

- Convert text to uppercase.
- Convert text to lowercase.
- Capitalize your text.
- Copy your retouched text to the clipboard.
- And many more features!
